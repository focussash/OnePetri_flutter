# onepetri

Flutter implementation of OnePetri

## About

This project is the porting of [OnePetri app for IOS by Michael Shamash] (https://github.com/mshamash/OnePetri). This project is coded on Flutter mostly for (my own) practice purpose; 
only Android's side of implementations are currently updated and maintained.

## Functionalities and future updates
This project currently supports all the core functionalities of OnePetri IOS (automatically detecting petri dishes and counting plaques). I will try to keep this project up to date
with any updates on OnePetri IOS

## Still under construction
Plaque assay function of OnePetri IOS under construction. 
To be added to Play store for easier distribution
